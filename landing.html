<title>Why can you get online anyway?</title>
<h3>Can't seem to figure out why you're able to get online? Well lets look into that.</h3>
<br>
<p>Reason 1: Your WiFi is turned on</p>
<p>Having your WiFi turned on allows you to connect to the Internet wirelessly. Try turning it off, then come back here.</p>
<button onclick="alert('How are you still here?? I thought you turned off your WiFi ðŸ¤”')">Click if you're still here after turning off your WiFi.</button>
<br>
<br>
<p>Reason 2: Your Ethernet cable is plugged into your computer</p>
<p>An Ethernet cable allows you to connect to the internet using a cable thats connected from your Computer to your router. Try unplugging it, then come back here.</p>
<button onclick="alert('Hmm, somethings not right here, you\'re supposed to be gone, there\'s no way you could possibly be here right now.')">Click if you're still here after unplugging your Ethernet cable.</button>
<br>
<br>
<p>Reason 3: Your Router is plugged into the wall</p>
<p>Your Router being plugged into the wall means that its getting an internet connection. Try unplugging it to prevent it from connecting to the internet, then come back here.</p>
<button onclick="alert('Honestly, I really thought that would do the trick, I guess not')">Click if you're still here after unplugging your Router from the wall.</button>
<br>
<br>
<p>Reason 4: You're using your Neighbor's internet<p>
<p>To be fair, if you're using your Neighbor's internet, there's not really much that can be done about that. Try knocking on your neighbor's door and asking them to either change their WiFi password, or put their Microwave on full blast to stop their internet from working, then come back here.</p>
<button onclick="alert('How is this possible? How are you even doing this? SO MANY QUESTIONS.')">Click if you're still here after embarrassing your Neighbor's and ruining their lives.</button>
<br>
<br>
<p>Reason 5: You're using free internet somewhere</p>
<p>The place you're at right now probably has free internet available and you're probably using it right now which could be allowing you to connect to the internet. Try moving a couple Microwave's into there and put them on full blast, then come back here.</p>
<button onclick="alert('Wow, you fool, I can\'t believe you actually did that, but how\'re you still here?')">Click if you're still here after effectively shutting down the coffee shop.</button>
<br>
<br>
<p>Reason 6: You're using someone's Mobile Hotspot</p>
<p>Whoever you're with right probably has their Phone's Mobile Hotspot turned on and you're probably using it right now, which may be enabling you to get online. Try yeeting their Phone at a tree, then come back here.</p>
<button onclick="alert('Well, I\'m pretty sure they hate you now, so good job. You\'re still here huh? I\'m starting to question your existence, are you sure you\'re real? Because i haven\'t seen anybody manage to still get online after going through six methods to get rid of their Internet connection.')">Click if you're still here after ruining your friendship.</button>
<br>
<br>
<p>Reason 7: You're using a Portable Hotspot device</p>
<p>A Portable Hotspot such as the Verizon MiFi Jetpack, allow's you to have a WiFi connection wherever you go with it, you probably have one of these and are connected to it right now. Try running it over with your car, then come back here.</p>
<button onclick="alert('At this point, I bet you\'re just doing this to see my reaction, I don\'t blame you, I would do the same thing.')">Click if you're still here after you destroyed one of your expensive electronics.</button>
<br>
<br>
<p>Reason 8: You're using Satilite Internet</p>
<p>Satilite Internet is normally used in more remote areas' and rural areas' where it's harder to get regular Internet. Try climbing ontop of your house with a stick and beat the crap out the Satilite until it falls down.</p>
<button onclick="alert('So let me guess, you\'re still alive after that fall? that\'s supprising. I assume that your Internet still works, right? I\'m gonna figure out how you're doing this, just watch.')">Click if you're still here after falling off your roof and breaking your neck.</button>
<br>
<br>
<p>Reason 9: You're using DSL Internet</p>
<p>DSL was used back when Dial-Up internet was still a thing, and is still used to this day, but is not as common. Try ramming your car into the Telephone pole outside of your house, or setting the pole on fire.</p>
<button onclick="alert('So, how\'d that work out for ya? Are you feeling accomplished now? Your internet still works too? ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡')">Click if you're still here after commiting Arson, ramming your car in a Telephone pole, then going to prison.</button>
<br>
<br>
<p>Reason 10: You're using Mobile Data</p>
<p>Your Mobile Data allows you to use the Internet on your phone without WiFi. Try knocking down the cell tower with a wrecking ball.</p>
<button onclick="alert('Wow, i\'m just lost for words, how\'d you even manage to get a wrecking ball and get anywhere close to that tower?')">Click if you're still here after commiting a felony.</button>
<br>
<br>
<p>Reason 11: You're connected directly to the cell tower</p>
<p>I don't get how this would even be possible, but I guess it is. Being connected directly to the cell tower allows you to be connected to the Internet with the fastest speed allowed by the Tower. Try setting off an EMP on the Cell Tower.</p>
<button onclick="alert('Dammit, i\'m running out of ideas here! At this point i\'m just making things up. It\'s supprising that you\'ve even gotten this far to begin with, what\'re you doing with your life?')">Click if you're still here after shutting down a cell tower like an idiot.</button>
<br>
<br>
<p>Reason 12: You're connected directly to the wires coming out of the ground</p>
<p>Being connected directly to the wires coming out of the ground, while not ideal, it provides the best connection possible to the internet. Try using a machete to cut the wire.</p>
<button onclick="alert('So like, i\'m pretty sure your whole neighborhood wants to jump you now that you cut out their internet. I told you that you should\'ve cut the blue wire and not the red wire, it\'s not rocket science y\'know!')">Click if you're still here after cutting off the whole neighborhoods Internet.</button>
<br>
<br>
<p>Reason 13: You're connected directly to the Satilite on top of your house</p>
<p>Although unrealistic, being connected directly to the satellite you have on your house, will provide the best connection allowed by the satellite. Now, i know you're not gonna get up there again and get hospitalized, so instead, burn down your house to get rid of everything including the satilite.</p>
<button onclick="alert('Great, now you're homeless, what\'re you gonna do now?')">Click if you're still here after being stupid enough to burn down your house.</button>
<br>
<br>
<p>Reason 14: You're connected directly to the Satilites in space</p>
<p>I don't know how this would be really possible and i doubt this would actually get you internet. Try stealing one of NASA's space shuttles to get up there and knock the satilite out of orbit.</p>
<button onclick="alert('How\'d you manage to sneak into a NASA facility and steal a space shuttle without getting caught and ontop of that still be alive? Something definitely isn\'t right here.')">Click if you're still here after dying in space.</button>
<br>
<br>
<p>Reason 15: You're using a solar panel to get your internet from the sun</p>
<p>I never thought this would be possible to accomplish, so how're you even doing it? Try throwing the solar panel in the ocean.</p>
<button onclick="alert('Don'\t you think that would've cut out your power too? What are you even doing with your life?')">Click if you're still here after getting rid of what's hopefully your last source of internet.</button>
<br>
<br>
<p>Reason 16: You're using the old AT&T LongLines system to get your Internet</p>
<p>AT&T LongLines was an old system used back in the 1980's for telecommunications, they utilized tall towers with big Microwave Horn Antennas on them. Try setting off a nuke next to the tower.</p>
<button onclick="alert('How could you possibly survive that blast? That\'s damn near impossible! GOD DAMN METAHUMANS!!!')">Click if you're still here after blowing up your entire neighborhood and dying in a nuclear blast.</button>
<br>
<br>
<p>Reason 17: You're devices still work<p>
<p>Well obviously if your devices still work, you'll still be able to find some other method of getting online. Try throwing your devices off of a skyscraper in order to destroy them.</p>
<button onclick="alert('First of all, how did you get on top of a sky scraper? and second of all, is that a Nokia 3310 you're using? I thought I said all of your devices! )">Click if you're still here after getting rid of all of your devices.</button>
<br>
<p>You seem to of reached the end! Thank you for visiting, this took me a very long time to make.</p>
